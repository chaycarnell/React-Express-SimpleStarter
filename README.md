# Express + React starter app

A simple client and server app using Express and React

### Getting Started

To get started:

1. Clone from this repo and run 'npm i' from a terminal within the app's root directory
2. Configure your local development environment by creating a .env file referencing the .env-sample file included
3. The app can be launched locally for development using 'npm run dev:client' & 'npm run dev:server'
4. To test the application run 'npm run test', this will run the Jest tests suite
5. This application has a couple of hooks to enforce code quality using Husky, commits to Git will trigger linting, pushing will run the tests first and then lint. Either of these throwing an error will abort the process.
6. To build the app for a production release run 'npm run build'
