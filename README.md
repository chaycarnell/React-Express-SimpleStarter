A React+Express starter project using Vite for fast frontend development and efficient build tooling, as well as npm workspaces.

### Getting Started

To get started:

1. Clone from this repo and run `npm i` at the app's root directory
3. Configure your local development environment for the server and client by creating `.env` files referencing the `.env-sample` files included in each package
4. The app can be launched locally for development using `npm run start:dev` which will start both the client app and server app in watch mode
5. You can build and run the server with the frontend application being served by running `npm run build`
6. This application uses Husky commit and push hooks to enforce code quality
7. The project has scripts already created for deployment to Heroku, you can create a new Heroku app and deploy a fork of this repository to try it out yourself
